    <h1>Brandon Andreis</h1>

    <h2>Email: bjandreis@gmail.com</h2>

    <h2>Fun fact:</h2>

    <p>I have a twin brother, Michael. We're fraternal though so we don't look much alike. He's also a lot different
        personality-wise.</p>

    <h2>Games that I really like:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Old School Runescape</li>
        <li>Super Smash Bros Ultimate</li>
        <li>Don't Starve Together</li>
        <li>Starbound</li>
        <li>SCP: Secret Laboratory</li>
        <li>Hollow Knight</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What I'm excited about:</h2>

    <p>
        I'm looking forward to dusting off my knowledge of HTML and CSS and improving upon what I learned in my high
        school web design class 8 years ago.<br>
        I haven't touched on web design much since then so I'm very rusty. I also haven't learned any Javascript either
        so that should be interesting; although<br>
        I understand that it probably isn't going to be easy. People always say Javascript is difficult to get into,
        especially as a first language.
    </p>

    <h2>Favorite place on the web:</h2>

    <p>It has to be <a href="https://youtube.com" target="_blank">YouTube</a>. It's without a doubt the place I spend
        the most time on the web at.</p>

    <h2>What motivated me to take this class?</h2>

    <p>
        The older I've gotten, the more uncertain I've become about my future. I went to college for 6 years doing a
        digital arts program called Simulation, Animation<br>
        and Gaming. I always liked the idea of being a part of a game development studio as a kid because I love video
        games. Over time, my passion for<br>
        3D modeling, texturing, rigging, animating, etc. had completely evaporated and I don't really know why. That's
        when I figured it was time to throw in the towel and<br>
        go find a job doing something else. I was 24 years old and hadn't even worked a job yet. When I heard Amazon was
        opening a new fulfillment center really close to<br>
        where I live, I figured it would've at least been a good first step and a way to finally start making some
        money.<br>

        <br>To my surprise, a little over a year later, Amazon offers a program with Kenzie Academy for web development. I
        figured I might as well take the opportunity since<br>
        I have a little bit of experience with HTML and CSS thanks to the one class in high school and the one class in
        college I took for it. I'm hoping this course can sort<br>
        of serve as a new beginning for me since I've been having a bit of an existential crisis for the past few years.
        The prospect of getting a job in tech does sound nice<br>
        so I suppose that's what motivated me to take this course the most.
